The Item Response Warehouse (IRW) is a collection of open, harmonized item response datasets. Responses can be scored in a variety of ways (dichotomous, polytomous, continuous) but need to be cross-classified by the focus of measurement (typically a person) and the measurement tool (typically an item).
