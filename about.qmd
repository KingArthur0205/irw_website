[This website](https://github.com/langcog/irw_site) is made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), with interactive visualizations in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). The data are stored on [Redivis](https://redivis.com/).

IRW was created by [Ben Domingue](http://domingue.stanford.edu/) (Graduate School of Education, Stanford University). This website was made in collaboration with [Mike Frank](http://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) and [Mika Braginsky](https://mikabr.io/) (Psychology Department, Stanford University).
