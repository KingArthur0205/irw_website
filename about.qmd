The Item Response Warehouse (IRW) is a collection of open, harmonized item response datasets. Responses can be scored in a variety of ways (dichotomous, polytomous, continuous) but need to be cross-classified by the focus of measurement (typically a person) and the measurement tool (typically an item). Information about the nature of the datasets (including references to papers and URLs) are available in the Documentation page. Code used to generate the harmonized versions of the dataset can be found at [github link]
