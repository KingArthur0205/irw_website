  The Item Response Warehouse (IRW) is a collection of open, harmonized item response datasets.
  
  *Open: The data are licensed for public reformatting and reuse. 
  
  *Harmonized: The data are formatted to a common standard. The goal of the IRW is to make large quantities of data available for standardized analysis given the common formatting. 
  
  *Item Response: The IRW is comprised of cross-classified item responses. The key element required of data for inclusion in the IRW is that the data need to report individual responses that are cross-classified by the focus of measurement (typically a person) and the measurement tool (typically an item).
  
  These datasets in IRW span a wide range of measures; examples include measures of ability in education settings, measures of partisanship based on voting records, and personality measures based on survey questions.  Responses can be scored in a variety of ways (dichotomous, polytomous, continuous) and may contain additional data (e.g., response time).
